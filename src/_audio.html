    <h2>How the deadly-force debate unfolded</h2>
    <p>
      In 1985, state senators engaged in a heated debate over the use of deadly force by police officers. Some argued that high-value theft justified use of deadly force and that restricting police gives the criminal "underworld" a "license to steal."" The bill's sponsors encouraged a closer examination of situations that merit its use and more regard for human life. The original debate lasted almost one hour and has been condensed.
